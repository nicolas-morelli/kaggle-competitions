# kaggle-competitions
This repository contains several entries to Kaggle Competitions. The spirit of the entries is merely to practice with new dataset and use different algorithms and strategies. In other words, for fun.

## Car Prices
### Difficulties
The dataset contained mainly categorical variables. Some feature engineering was needed to reduce the options. Moreover, I took the opportunity to apply word embeddings. Due to outliers, the log of the price is calculated, which gave better results.

### Algorithm
A neural network with word embeddings.

### Results and Placement
